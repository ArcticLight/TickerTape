TickerTape
==========

Simple Processing application that will animate with scrolling text.

Notes:
GitHub has this thing about only uploading source code. So, only the source is given. Not the supporting font file.
To set it up, it needs a font file. This can be made easily inside processing itself; give it the name font.vlw and place it in the data directory.

A sample messages.txt is provided, containing the article Wikipedia, from Wikipedia as retrieved on... whenever it was I grabbed it.

Next steps would be to actually get this to probe the net for interesting things to say, instead of reading from a static file.
That way, it really will be like an old ticker tape, a stream of news!

TODO: Code commenting and cleanup; current version was authored in two hours and involves terrible coding style.
TODO: Make this connect to the internet and grab interesting things to say, maybe from a newsfeed, or just print out a random Wikipedia article?
TODO: More fun with scrolling, possibly more than one line of text on screen at once, racing each other?
