TickerTape
==========

Simple Processing application that will animate with scrolling text.

Notes:
GitHub has this thing about only uploading source code. So, only the source is given.
To set it up, it needs a font file. This can be made easily inside processing itself; give it the name font.vlw

A sample messages.txt is provided, containing the article Wikipedia, from Wikipedia as retrieved on... whenever it was I grabbed it.

Next steps would be to actually get this to probe the net for interesting things to say, instead of reading from a static file.
That way, it really will be like an old ticker tape, a stream of news!
